# rockpaperscissors

## The Purpose of this program is that you can play a nice game of Rock, Paper, and Scissors with the computer.

## As a developer of this program, here is pseudo as to how it was to be worked out

- Create a couple of variables to 
    - store the user input
    - store wins, losses and ties

- The computer will generate a random characters from the list of characters (rps).
- The computer's character should be compared to the users character.
    - if the user has a winning hand, then mark the winslosstie variable as having a win, same with loss, and same with tie.
- The user can be asked again if they want to play, quit if not.
